# Anomaly-Detection-And-Movie-Recommendations-System

## **Overview**


This is a Data Modeling project using PostgreSQL. This project builds an ETL pipeline using Python using generated song data. The datas are in json and this project analyzes the songs to discern what songs the users are listening to. 


This is a Anamoly Detection and Recommender system using MATLAB. 

The anamoly detection project uses the Multivariate Gaussian Distribution to fit the training data. There are 307 collected data, m=307, when the detection algorithm detect anomalous behavior in the computer servers, thus the unlabeled dataset { x^1, ..., x^m}. The features measure the throughput (mb/s) and latency (ms) of response of each server.
