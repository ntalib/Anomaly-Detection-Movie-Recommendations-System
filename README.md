# Anomaly-Detection-And-Movie-Recommendations-System

## **Overview**


This is a Anamoly Detection and Recommender system using MATLAB. 

The anamoly detection project uses the Multivariate Gaussian Distribution to fit the training data. There are 307 collected data, m=307, when the detection algorithm detect anomalous behavior in the computer servers, thus the unlabeled dataset { x^1, ..., x^m}. The features measure the throughput (mb/s) and latency (ms) of response of each server.
